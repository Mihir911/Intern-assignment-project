# Scalability Considerations

##  Current Architecture
- Monolithic REST API with modular structure
- JWT-based authentication with role-based access
- MongoDB Atlas for cloud database
- Environment-based configuration

##  Scalability Improvements

### 1. Database Optimization
- Add indexing for frequently queried fields
- Implement database connection pooling
- Use MongoDB sharding for large datasets

### 2. API Improvements
- Implement rate limiting
- Add request caching with Redis
- Use compression middleware
- Implement API gateway for microservices

### 3. Deployment & Infrastructure
- Containerize with Docker
- Use load balancers (NGINX)
- Implement horizontal scaling
- Add monitoring & logging (ELK stack)

### 4. Security Enhancements
- Implement refresh token rotation
- Add request rate limiting
- Use HTTPS in production
- Regular security audits
